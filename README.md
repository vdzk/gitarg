# Gitarg
Gitarg attempts to make arguing more rigorous by using [Bayesian networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network) to verify subjective probabilities of contentious events. Its features include:
* causal network editor with automatic layout,
* inferring posterior probabilities of events,
* comparing relevances of alternative explanations,
* swapping between alternative points of view,
* persisting user data in localstorage and save files.
